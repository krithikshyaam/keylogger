This Python program performs a basic keylogger detection scan by analyzing all currently running system processes using the `psutil` library, checking each process’s name and execution path for suspicious indicators such as common keylogger-related keywords (keylog, logger, hook, spy) and execution from unusual directories like AppData, Temp, or Public user folders; when a match is found, the program flags the process as suspicious and displays its process ID, name, and executable path, and if no matches are detected, it reports that no suspicious keylogger activity is present, making the script a simple heuristic-based, non-intrusive tool designed strictly for educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes without capturing keystrokes or violating user privacy.
